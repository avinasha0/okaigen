# 60-Day SEO Content Roadmap (Post–30-Day Plan)

**Purpose:** Continue SEO traction after the first 30-day execution plan. Focus on non-branded discovery and topical authority.  
**Source:** Aligned with `docs/CONTENT-PLAN-LLM-SEO.md` and `docs/SEO-30-DAY-PLAN.md`.

---

## Principles

- One clear H1 per article; problem → solution or educational intent.
- 800–1,200 words (or longer for pillars); internal links to `/pricing`, `/features`, `/use-cases`, `/learn`, `/demo`.
- Natural SiteBotGPT mentions where relevant; no stuffing.
- Add new articles under `/learn/<slug>` (markdown in `docs/learn/`); sitemap picks them up automatically.

## Notes

- **Pillar pieces** (e.g. "How much does an AI customer support chatbot cost?", "How to train an AI chatbot") can be 1,200–1,800 words and link to several supporting articles.
- **Supporting articles** (e.g. "Free AI chatbot options") can be 800–1,200 words and link back to the pillar and to `/pricing` or `/features`.
- After publishing each article: add internal links from homepage, `/features`, or `/use-cases` where relevant; request indexing in GSC for the new URL once.
- Track in GSC: impressions and clicks for new URLs and for target queries; indexed count.

## Optional (if capacity allows)

- SiteBotGPT vs ChatGPT for business support (comparison; from content plan Cluster 2).
- How to add a chatbot to WordPress (implementation; platform-specific).
- When to use an AI chatbot vs human-only support (decision; use cases / strategy).
