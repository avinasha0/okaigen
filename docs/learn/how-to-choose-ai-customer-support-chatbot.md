# How to choose an AI customer support chatbot

Choosing an AI customer support chatbot means matching the product to your content, support volume, and goals. The right tool trains on your content, embeds easily, captures leads when needed, and fits your budget. This page gives a practical checklist so you can compare options and decide quickly.

## TL;DR

When choosing an AI customer support chatbot, prioritize: (1) training only on your content for accurate, on-brand answers, (2) simple embed (one script or plugin), (3) lead capture when the bot is unsure or the visitor wants human follow-up, (4) analytics to see what visitors ask and improve over time, and (5) clear pricing and limits. Avoid tools that rely on generic AI knowledge for support answers or that require heavy custom development for basic use.

## 1. Training on your content

An **AI customer support chatbot** should answer from your content—website pages, help docs, PDFs, and product information—not from the model’s general knowledge. That keeps answers accurate and on-brand and reduces hallucinations.

When comparing products, check:

- **Sources supported:** Website URL(s), sitemaps, uploaded files (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD), pasted text.
- **How updates work:** You add or edit content and the bot re-indexes without a long, manual process.
- **Answer scope:** The bot is instructed to say "I don't know" or offer lead capture when your content doesn’t contain the answer.

For more on how this works, see [What is an AI customer support chatbot?](/learn/what-is-ai-customer-support-chatbot) and [How do AI chatbots work?](/learn/how-do-ai-chatbots-work).

## 2. Embed and deployment

You need to get the chatbot on your site with minimal effort. Look for:

- **One-snippet embed:** A single script tag (or one plugin) that you add to your site. The widget appears on all pages where the script loads.
- **Platform fit:** Works on your stack (e.g. WordPress, Shopify, React, static HTML, help center).
- **No per-page setup:** You don’t have to configure the bot on every URL for basic use.

If you need a custom UI or server-side integration, check whether the product offers an API on the plan you’re considering.

## 3. Lead capture and handoff

Support and sales often want to capture visitors who ask for a human, a demo, or pricing. A good **AI customer support chatbot** lets you:

- **Trigger capture** when the bot is uncertain or when the visitor says they want to talk to someone.
- **Collect fields** such as email, name, and phone in the chat.
- **Send leads** to a dashboard, CSV, or webhook so your team can follow up.

Without this, high-intent visitors may leave instead of filling a form. See [use cases](/use-cases) for how teams use lead capture in practice.

---

## 4. Analytics and improvement

You need to see what visitors ask and how the bot performs. Look for at least:

- **Chat history** so you can read conversations and spot gaps.
- **Top questions or themes** so you know what to add to your knowledge base.
- **Basic metrics** such as number of conversations, resolution, or leads.

Some tools add satisfaction ratings or A/B tests; helpful but not required to get started. Use the data to add or update content and retrain so the bot improves over time.

---

## 5. Pricing and limits

Compare:

- **Free tier:** How many bots, messages per day or month, and which features (e.g. lead capture, analytics) are included.
- **Paid tiers:** How limits scale (messages, bots, API, remove branding, priority support).
- **Flexibility:** Upgrade/downgrade and cancellation without long lock-in.

Transparent pricing and a low-friction way to try the product (e.g. free plan, trial) make it easier to validate fit. For an example, see [SiteBotGPT pricing](/pricing).

## Next steps

Once you’ve shortlisted products that meet these criteria, try their demos and free tiers. Add a small set of content (e.g. your main help page and a few FAQs), embed the widget, and ask the kinds of questions your visitors would ask. If answers are accurate and lead capture works as you expect, you’ve found a good fit.

For a product built around content-trained support, lead capture, and simple embed, try the [SiteBotGPT demo](/demo) or read about [features](/features) and [website chatbot software](/learn/website-chatbot-software).
