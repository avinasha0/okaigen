# What is a website chatbot?

A website chatbot is a chat interface that visitors see when they visit a business's website. It is embedded on the site—usually as a bubble in the corner of the page—and lets visitors ask questions or get help without leaving the page. Website chatbots can be rule-based (following predefined scripts) or AI-trained (answering from the business's content); the latter are often called [AI website chatbots](/learn/what-is-ai-customer-support-chatbot) or website support bots.

## TL;DR

A website chatbot is a chat widget embedded on a business's website. It appears to visitors as a chat bubble and opens a panel where they can type questions. Website chatbots can be rule-based (scripted responses) or AI-trained (answers from the business's content). They serve first-line support, FAQs, and lead capture. They differ from in-app chatbots (inside products or apps) and from generic chat widgets that connect only to live agents.

## What makes a chatbot a "website" chatbot

Three things define a website chatbot:

**Embedded on the site.** The chatbot appears on the website itself—on the homepage, product pages, or help pages. Visitors do not have to open a separate app or visit another URL. The widget is usually a small bubble (often in the bottom-right corner) that expands into a chat panel when clicked. Adding it typically requires pasting a short script tag into the site's code.

**Trained on site content (for AI chatbots).** AI website chatbots are trained on the business's own content: website pages, help articles, FAQs, or documents. They answer from this content rather than from general knowledge. This makes them suited for questions about the business's products, policies, and services. Rule-based website chatbots use predefined scripts and menus instead.

**First-line support.** Website chatbots typically handle the first contact with visitors. They answer common questions, point visitors to the right pages, or capture contact details when a human is needed. They reduce the load on support teams by handling repetitive queries before they become tickets.

## Website chatbot vs in-app chatbot

**Website chatbot.** Lives on the business's public website. It serves anyone who visits the site—prospects, customers, or casual browsers. Use cases include answering product questions, capturing leads, and providing support before or after purchase. The visitor may not have an account or be logged in.

**In-app chatbot.** Lives inside a product or application (e.g. a SaaS dashboard, mobile app, or internal tool). It serves logged-in users who are already using the product. Use cases include in-product help, onboarding, troubleshooting within the app, and internal employee support. It often has access to the user's account context (e.g. which plan they are on, what they have done in the app).

Both can be rule-based or AI-trained. The main difference is location and audience: website chatbots reach website visitors; in-app chatbots reach product users.

## Website chatbot vs generic chat widget

**Generic chat widget.** Often a simple live-chat widget that connects visitors to a human agent. It may have a few canned replies or a short FAQ, but it does not answer questions intelligently on its own. When no agent is online, it may show a message or a form. Rule-based variants use rigid scripts: if the visitor says X, show reply Y. They cannot handle variations in phrasing or complex questions.

**AI website chatbot.** Trained on the business's content and can [answer a wide range of questions in natural language](/learn/how-do-ai-chatbots-work). It does not require a live agent to be online. It understands different ways of asking the same question and can combine information from multiple sources. When unsure, it can say "I don't know" or offer to capture the visitor's details for follow-up.

The key distinction: rule-based widgets follow fixed rules; AI-trained chatbots use the business's content to generate answers. Platforms like SiteBotGPT provide AI website chatbots that the business trains on its own content.

## Common use cases on websites

**Support.** Answering questions about products, shipping, returns, and policies. Visitors get immediate answers instead of waiting for email or phone support.

**FAQs.** Handling frequently asked questions conversationally. Visitors can ask in their own words instead of scanning a long FAQ page.

**Lead capture.** Collecting name and email when the visitor asks for a demo, pricing, or to talk to someone. The chatbot engages first, then hands off to sales or support with context.

**Guidance.** Helping visitors find the right page, product, or resource. For example: "Which plan fits my team size?" or "Where do I find the API docs?"

**After-hours availability.** Answering questions when support staff are not online. The chatbot provides 24/7 coverage for common queries.

## FAQs

**1. Is a website chatbot the same as live chat?**

No. Live chat connects visitors to human agents in real time. A website chatbot can work without any agent online—it answers from its training or rules. Some setups combine both: the chatbot handles simple questions and escalates to a human when needed.

**2. Do I need to code to add a website chatbot?**

Often no. Many platforms provide a script tag that you paste into your site. The chatbot appears automatically. Some platforms offer plugins for WordPress, Shopify, and other systems. Custom integrations may require development.

**3. Can a website chatbot capture leads?**

Yes. Many AI website chatbots are configured to ask for name and email when they cannot answer a question or when the visitor requests human contact. The captured details go to the business's dashboard or CRM for follow-up.

**4. What content does an AI website chatbot need?**

Website URLs, help articles, FAQs, product documentation, PDFs, or other text the business uses to answer customers. The more accurate and up-to-date the content, the better the chatbot's answers.

**5. Does a website chatbot work on mobile?**

Yes. Chat widgets are usually responsive and work on mobile browsers. The bubble and chat panel adapt to smaller screens. Some platforms also offer standalone mobile experiences.
