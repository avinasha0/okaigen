# Website chatbot software: what to look for

Website chatbot software lets you add a chat widget to your site so visitors can get answers or help without leaving the page. The best options train on your content, embed with minimal code, and support lead capture and analytics. This page outlines what to look for when choosing website chatbot software so you can pick a solution that fits your support and growth goals.

## TL;DR

When evaluating website chatbot software, prioritize: training on your own content (not generic AI), easy embed (e.g. one script tag), lead capture when the bot is unsure or the visitor wants human help, and clear pricing. Avoid tools that rely only on generic knowledge, require heavy coding, or lack analytics. Platforms like SiteBotGPT focus on content-trained bots, one-snippet embed, and transparent plans.

## Why training on your content matters

Generic chatbots that answer from public data or a single FAQ list often give wrong or off-brand answers. **Website chatbot software that trains on your content**—your site, help docs, PDFs, and product pages—keeps answers accurate and on-brand. The bot should use only the information you provide and say "I don't know" when your content doesn't cover the question. That reduces hallucinations and builds trust.

Look for:

- Support for multiple sources: website URL(s), sitemaps, uploaded files (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD), or pasted text.
- Clear indexing and retraining: you add or update content and the bot reflects it without complex pipelines.
- No reliance on the model's general knowledge for business-specific answers.

## Easy embed and deployment

Your team may not have developers on standby. **Good website chatbot software** offers a simple embed—typically one script tag you paste before the closing `</body>` of your site. The chat bubble and panel should work across pages without extra configuration per URL. It should work on common platforms: WordPress, Shopify, React, static HTML, and help centers.

Check:

- One-snippet (or one-plugin) install.
- No iframes or complex auth for the public widget.
- Optional API for custom UIs or server-side use on higher plans.

## Lead capture and handoff

Visitors often ask for a human, a demo, or pricing. **Website chatbot software** should let you capture their details (e.g. email, name, phone) when the bot is unsure or when the visitor explicitly asks for follow-up. Leads should flow into your dashboard or a CSV so sales or support can act. Without this, you lose high-intent visitors who don't want to hunt for a contact form.

Look for:

- Configurable lead capture (when to show the form: on "I don't know", on "talk to someone", or on specific intents).
- Where leads go: in-app list, webhook, or export.
- Optional handoff to live chat if you add it later.

---

## Analytics and improvement

You need to know what visitors ask and how the bot performs. **Solid website chatbot software** provides at least:

- Chat history and message counts.
- Top questions or themes.
- Basic metrics (e.g. conversations, resolution, leads).

That lets you spot gaps in your content and improve answers over time. Some tools also offer A/B tests or satisfaction prompts; useful but not mandatory for getting started.

---

## Pricing and limits

Pricing models vary: free tier, then paid by messages, bots, or seats. When comparing **website chatbot software**, check:

- What the free tier includes (how many bots, messages per day/month, features).
- How paid tiers scale (message caps, number of bots, API, remove branding).
- Whether you can upgrade or downgrade without lock-in.

Transparent pricing and a free or low-cost way to try the product make it easier to validate fit before committing. See [SiteBotGPT pricing](/pricing) for an example of free and paid plans.

## Summary checklist

- **Training:** Trains on your content (URLs, docs, files); answers only from that content.
- **Embed:** One script tag or simple plugin; works on your stack.
- **Leads:** Capture email/name/phone when the bot is unsure or visitor wants human follow-up.
- **Analytics:** Chat history and top questions so you can improve.
- **Pricing:** Clear free and paid tiers; scale that matches your traffic.

Choosing website chatbot software with these in mind helps you get an AI support agent that stays accurate, deploys quickly, and supports both support deflection and lead generation.
