# AI chatbot for website: a short guide

An AI chatbot for your website is a chat widget that visitors see on your site and that answers their questions using your content—your website, docs, and files—instead of generic knowledge. This guide explains what it is, why teams use one, and how to get started so you can decide if it's right for you.

## TL;DR

An AI chatbot for website is software that you train on your own content (site, docs, PDFs) and embed on your site. Visitors get instant, on-brand answers 24/7. It reduces support load, handles FAQs, and can capture leads when the bot is unsure or someone wants human help. You add your content, get an embed snippet, and put it on your site—no coding required for basic setup. Free tiers are common; paid plans add more messages, bots, and features.

## What is an AI chatbot for website?

An **AI chatbot for website** is a chat interface that appears on your website (usually a bubble in the corner) and answers visitor questions in natural language. Unlike rule-based bots that follow fixed scripts, it uses AI to understand different phrasings and pull answers from the content you provide. That content might be your marketing site, help center, product docs, or uploaded PDFs and documents. The bot does not answer from the open internet or generic training; it answers only from your materials. That keeps responses accurate and on-brand.

## Why use an AI chatbot for your website?

Teams add an AI chatbot for their website to solve a few core problems:

**Support volume.** Many questions are repetitive—hours, pricing, returns, how-to. An AI chatbot can answer those from your content 24/7, so your team spends less time on the same FAQs.

**Availability.** Visitors in other time zones or browsing at night get immediate answers instead of waiting for email or business hours.

**Consistency.** Everyone gets the same information from your content. There’s no variation between agents or outdated answers if you keep your sources updated.

**Lead capture.** When the bot isn’t sure or a visitor asks for a human, demo, or quote, you can capture their email and name in the chat. Those leads go to your dashboard or CRM for follow-up.

**Deflection.** By handling simple questions, the bot reduces tickets so support can focus on complex or sensitive issues.

## How to get started

1. **Choose a platform.** Pick a product that trains on your content, offers a simple embed (e.g. one script tag), and supports lead capture. Compare [website chatbot software](/learn/website-chatbot-software) options using a short checklist (training, embed, leads, analytics, pricing).

2. **Add your content.** Add your website URL (and sitemap if needed), upload key docs or PDFs, or paste text. The platform indexes this into a knowledge base. The better and more up-to-date the content, the better the answers.

3. **Embed on your site.** Copy the embed code (usually one script tag) and add it before the closing `</body>` of your site. The chat bubble appears on every page where the script loads. No per-page configuration needed for basic use.

4. **Configure behavior.** Set tone (formal, friendly), add suggested prompts or FAQs, and configure when to capture leads (e.g. when the bot says "I don't know" or when the visitor asks for a human).

5. **Review and improve.** Use chat history and analytics to see what visitors ask. Fill gaps in your content and retrain so the bot gets better over time.

Many platforms, including [SiteBotGPT](/), offer a free plan so you can try with one bot and limited messages before upgrading. You can [try the demo](/demo) or [see pricing](/pricing) to get started.

## What to expect

- **Setup:** From a few minutes (small site) to an hour (lots of pages or docs). No coding required for the standard embed.
- **Accuracy:** Depends on your content. Keep help docs and product pages updated and the bot will reflect that.
- **Limits:** Free tiers often cap messages per day or month and number of bots. Paid plans add capacity, API, and sometimes white-label.

An AI chatbot for your website works best when you have clear, current content and a defined set of questions you want it to handle. Use it to complement human support, not replace it for complex or sensitive conversations. For more on that balance, read [Can AI replace customer support?](/learn/can-ai-replace-customer-support).
